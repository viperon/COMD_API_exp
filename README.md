# COMD_API_exp
Script API call to the Comdirect bank, retrieve most recent transactions (current month, or last 3 months).
sort by months and classify the data into different columns depending on keywords within the transaction description.
save monthly dfs into csv.
generate a final main df that specifies the total amount spent on each category per month.
A final yearly analysis should be fairly straight forward with the date stored.
